# üìä Customer Behavior Analysis
In this project, I analyzed Cyclistic's company data to gain insights into customer behavior and answer stakeholder questions. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), conducted statistical analysis, and created visualizations to drive decision-making.

For the case study, I assumed the role of a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago.

## üö≤ Background
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a bike-sharing program that has experienced significant growth, currently operating 5824 bicycles and 692 docking stations. The finance analysts at Cyclistic have determined that annual members are more profitable than casual members, and maximizing the number of annual members is crucial for future growth.

The director of marketing has set a clear goal for the marketing team: to design strategies that convert casual riders into annual members. To support this objective, my business task is to analyze and understand the differences in how annual members and casual riders utilize Cyclistic bikes. This analysis will inform the marketing team's efforts to design effective campaigns that target casual riders and convert them into loyal annual members.
